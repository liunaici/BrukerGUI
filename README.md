# BrukerGUI

BrukerGUI is a graphical interface for displaying and processing data obtained from measurements on a [BrukerÂ©](https://www.bruker.com) tomograph in the form of images with the necessary information. 

The application also allows you to save images or a series of images in a convenient way for later processing.
